## Webpack

To build the app, we use *Webpack*. It's a module bundler for modern Javascript applications.
We use it for many things :
- Transpile Javascript with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) 
- Compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files.
- Create one *.css* file from all the *.scss* files.
- Minify *.js* files
- Minify *.css* files
- Build the React.js files into one big file.
- Run a [dev server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) 

All of this is done automaticaly when you run ***npm start*** to run the app.

For more details, [see the webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/)
